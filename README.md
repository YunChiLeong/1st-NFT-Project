# Project Description
This is my first NFT Project
I am using Openzeppelin ERC1155 token contract for the smart contract,
Moralis server to host metadata and finally publish on Opensea Marketplace

# Current Progress - Jan 21, 2020
The smart contract code is complete. 
I implemented mint function (restricted to Owner) and
burn function (restricted current token owner)

The metadata data for the first 2 nft are complete. 
The json strings containing the metadata are hosted on a Moralis server. 

# Next task 
Getting test Ether from Rinkeby Ether Faucet, to deploy on test Opensea server.
PROGRESS ON PAUSE: Due to Rinkeby Ether Faucet not dispensing test Ether. 
I do not own any Ether myself to proceed. :(

# Future task
publish on Opensea Marketplace
